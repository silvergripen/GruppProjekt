**This is the start of a simple bank console app with an arrow selection menu where you can log in and create new customers as an admin,
open new accounts as a customer and get a list of your accounts with the balance shown.**

## Usage

`Admin social security number: 123` `Admin password: 0000`

First you need to log in as an admin to create your first customer.
Then you can log out and log in again as a customer.
**<br>NOTE! When you log out as a customer the list of customers will reset
and you'll have to re-add new customers in the admin menu again.**
- You have 3 tries to enter the correct password when you log in.
- You have 3 tries when you re-enter the social security number when opening a new account.
